A calculator in iOS swift. 

This colorful phone app is a learning project so I can explore mobile development. The app allows you to easily split up dinner costs among friends or add a tip, as well as do simple arithmetic. The app can be customized with different cat interfaces. While most of the functionality is complete I am still working on the views and graphical pieces.
